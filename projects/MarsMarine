This is a top down, twin stick shooter where the player has to survive waves of enemies to achieve a higher score. 
Enemy AI uses pawnsensing to detect the player location and chase the player.
This project was made using Unreal Engine 4's blueprint system with C++ and demonstrates proficiency in animation blueprints, blend spaces, and animation graphs. 
All assets made by Gamedev.tv.
